= Getting Started With Thrift =

gwt-rpc-plus includes an optimized compiler for thrift files that can output JSNI stubs for client-side use, as well as the corresponding server-side stubs.

The current approach in gwt-rpc-plus trades portability of client/server source for low code footprint on the client. 

== Compiling IDL ==

For each .thrift IDL, you'll need to perform three compilation passes

 # Compile the IDL with the native Thrift client (statically-linked executables for Linux/x86 and OSX are available in SVN)
 # Generate the client-side JSNI stubs with gwt-rpc-plus
 # Generate the server-side RPC stub with gwt-rpc-plus

=== Generating the server-side beans ===

The following command will generate the server-side Java beans:

{{{
thrift --gen java:beans -o example example.thrift
}}}

=== Generate the client-side JSNI objects and RPC stubs ===

The following command will generate the client-side JSNI objects, as well as the RPC stubs:

{{{
java -cp gwt-rpc-plus.jar com.dotspots.rpcplus.codegen.thrift.CodeGen --client --output example/gen-java-gwt example.thrift
}}}

=== Generate the server-side RPC handler ===

The following command will generate the server-side RPC handler:

{{{
java -cp gwt-rpc-plus.jar com.dotspots.rpcplus.codegen.thrift.CodeGen --server --output example/gen-json-server example.thrift
}}}
